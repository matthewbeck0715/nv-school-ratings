          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            The Nevada Department of Education (NDE) assigns each school a star rating from 1 to 5
            based on its Index Score. A 1-star rating indicates the lowest performing schools, while
            a 5-star rating indicates the highest performing schools. Not all schools receive a star
            rating — some schools may be excluded due to insufficient data or other eligibility
            criteria.

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            The Index Score is a composite score ranging from 0 to 100, calculated by NDE from
            multiple academic performance metrics. It provides an overall measure of a school&apos;s
            performance and is the basis for the star rating assignment.

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            ELA Proficiency and Math Proficiency represent the percentage of
            students at a school who met grade-level standards on Nevada state assessments. These
            percentages reflect how well students are performing against established academic
            benchmarks in each subject area.

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">Growth Metrics</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            ELA Growth and Math Growth measure year-over-year student progress. These scores are
            expressed as a percentile ranking that compares each student&apos;s growth to that of
            academic peers statewide — students who had similar prior test scores. A higher growth
            percentile means students at the school are making more progress relative to comparable
            students across Nevada.
