          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            The Nevada Department of Education (NDE) assigns each school a star rating from 1 to 5
            based on its Index Score. A 1-star rating indicates the lowest performing schools, while
            a 5-star rating indicates the highest performing schools. Not all schools receive a star
            rating — some schools may be excluded due to insufficient data or other eligibility
            criteria.

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            The Index Score is a composite score ranging from 0 to 100, calculated by NDE from
            multiple academic performance metrics. It provides an overall measure of a school&apos;s
            performance and is the basis for the star rating assignment.

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            ELA Proficiency and Math Proficiency represent the percentage of
            students at a school who met grade-level standards on Nevada state assessments. These
            percentages reflect how well students are performing against established academic
            benchmarks in each subject area.

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">Growth Metrics</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Growth - AGP and Growth - MGP are both measures of student progress over time, rather
            than a snapshot of proficiency — but they come from different sources and are
            calculated differently.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-3">
            <strong>Growth - AGP</strong> is the percentage of students at the school who met their
            individual growth target for the year — the amount of progress needed to reach or stay
            proficient. A higher percentage means more students are on track.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-3">
            <strong>Growth - MGP</strong> (Median Growth Percentile) comes from the Nevada Growth
            Model, which compares each student&apos;s year-over-year progress to academic peers
            statewide — students who had similar prior test scores. A school&apos;s MGP is the
            median of its students&apos; individual growth percentiles; 50 represents typical
            growth for the state. MGP is only reported for grades 3–8, so it does not appear for
            high schools.
